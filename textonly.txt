Tracking the Non-Place is an immersive, interactive projection-based installation that responds to the spatial and conceptual potential of The Cube, engaging visitors in a poetic meditation on Marc Augé’s theory of supermodernity. In this age where traditional markers of identity, place, and time have eroded, and instantaneity governs our social, emotional, and technological interactions, this work invites audiences to confront the fragmented nature of contemporary existence through computational photography, movement-tracking, and reactive image making.
